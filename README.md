###SudokuSolver

In this project I solve a Sudoku.
For Each possible numer (1-9)
  1- Find the possibles rows where can be set.
  2- For that places, remove if the number is repeat in the column.
  3-For that places, remove if the number is repeat in the square.
For Each possible place:/n
  1-Find if there is the only one possibility to fill the row with that number
  2-Find if there is the only one possibility to fill the column with that number
  3-Find if there is the only one possibility to fill the square with that number
  
The results are places that must be fill with each number./n
Replace the free spaces with the numbers./n
Repeat procces until there are no free spaces./n
