  1- Find the possibles rows where can be set./n
  2- For that places, remove if the number is repeat in the column./n
  3-For that places, remove if the number is repeat in the square./n
For Each possible place:/n
  1-Find if there is the only one possibility to fill the row with that number/n
  2-Find if there is the only one possibility to fill the column with that number/n
  3-Find if there is the only one possibility to fill the square with that number/n
